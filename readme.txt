== Description ==

This plugin adds user-submission links at the bottom of each post for various social bookmarking sites.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `slashdigglicious.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Aren't there already plugins to do this? =

Yes.

= Why another one? =

Because I can. See http://www.tsaiberspace.net/projects/wordpress/slashdigglicious/

= I like slashdigglicious, but can you add another site? =

Maybe. Let me know what it is. In the meantime, it is actually very easy to add
another site to the plugin code.

If you require something more flexible, you might consider <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bookmarkify/">Bookmarkify</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/share-this/">ShareThis</a>. The trade-off to consider is one of simplicity and speed vs. features, configurability, and possible site slowdown.

= Can I suppress the link icons on certain pages or posts? =

1. If the post contains `<!--slashdigglicious-->`, the link icons will appear.
1. If the post contains `<!--more-->`, the link icons will be turned off for non-single-post viewing modes.
1. If the post contains `<!--noslashdigglicious-->`, the link icons will be suppressed.
1. The link icons will be displayed at the end of the post.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is a screenshot of a single post with the user-submission icons and links at the bottom of the post content.
